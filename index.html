							Avoiding Punishment ( Stage 1 )<br><br>

							--Stage Explanation--<br>
							The reason why I chose ridin'<br>
							by Chamillionare is because<br>
							this song is perfect for<br>
							trying to avoid punishment,<br>
							the main aspect of the first<br>
							stage of kohlberg's model.<br><br>
							He consistently talks about pretty<br>
							much being a car chase with<br>
							the police, and how they are<br>
							"not going to catch him".

							Individualism and Exchange ( Stage 2 )<br><br>

							--Stage Explanation--<br>
							Although this song is very explicit<br>
							in true meaning, it's a pretty<br>
							good song for explaining how one <br>
							individual only does things for<br>
							the other person's rewards.<br>
							It's pretty much an interaction between<br>
							two people, flirting with each other,<br>
							and describing what they would do<br>
							to the other individual.<br>
							If nothing at all, a very unique song.<br>

							Good Boy and Good Girl ( Stage 3 )<br><br>

							--Stage Explanation--<br>
							This song is perfect for this stage.<br>
							It came to mind instantly,
							and I feel like it's great for a few reasons.<br>
							The song is written about a girl, and how all<br>
							bruno wanted was for her to show her love<br>
							to him, but all he was met with was a cold<br>
							hearted girl. He explains how he would butcher<br>
							himself in the most gruesome ways just to get her<br>
							to love him, even though he knows she wouldn't<br>
							do the same for him. He's ready to give up his<br>
							life just for her sign of approval, which<br>
							I believe is an extremity stemming from this stage.

							Law and Order Morality ( Stage 4 )<br><br>

							--Stage Explanation--<br>
							This song highlights the inequality<br>
							issues in america, and explains how people,<br>
							depending on race, face alternate consequences<br>
							for the same actions. It shows how they <br>
							have to follow the rules, otherwise face<br>
							grave consequences. Although the<br>
							original belief of the stage is that this<br>
							rule-following behavior is voluntary,<br>
							it still displays the same message.<br>

							--Associated Stage--<br>
							Social Contract ( Stage 5 )<br><br>

							--Stage Explanation--<br>
							This stage of moral development<br>
							is the stage in which people<br>
							convert from following the rules<br>
							blindly (like in stage 4) to following<br>
							rules that benefit society as a whole.<br>
							This song paved the way for African-American<br>
							artists to speak up about racism<br>
							and police brutality in a way no song<br>
							had ever done - straight to the throat.<br>
							It immediately hit the billboards and<br>
							became one of the most revered rap songs<br>
							in the game, and helped N. W. A. build their career.<br>
							The connection I'm making here is that N. W. A.<br>
							was the path that people could<br>
							take to decreasing racism against<br>
							African Americans, succesfully improving society.

							-----------------------------------------<br>
							I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>

							Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>

							--Associated Stage--<br>
							Universal Principles / Self-Determined Rules ( Stage 6 )<br><br>

							--Stage Explanation--<br>
							I'd say that Lose Yourself fits this<br>
							last stage for a few reasons, but it might<br>
							seem like a stretch at the beginning.<br>
							Eminem's life story, illustrated by his movie 8 Mile,<br>
							is a pretty bleak one, that ends up with<br>
							a somewhat-happy ending. Rags to Riches, so to speak.<br>
							This song shows how he was really treated back<br>
							when he was a kid and was just trying to survive.<br>
							As most of us know, Eminem got in his share<br>
							of fights when he was younger.<br>
							(If you didn't know this, you should watch 8 mile).<br>
							Basically, he had to break some rules to<br>
							get to where he is today, but none of them<br>
							were morally incorrect. Sometimes, in order to<br>
							succeed the most in life, you have to bend<br>
							the rules. Which is the exact underlying message<br>
							of the sixth and final stage from kohlberg's model.
