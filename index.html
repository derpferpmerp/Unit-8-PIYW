							--Applied Term--<br>
							Optimum arousal theory<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							This theory shows us<br>
							that we consistently <br>strive to be the best<br>
							version of ourselves, or<br> in this case, the<br>
							strongest version of ourselves.<br>
							In this verse, X <br>shows us just how angry<br>
							and fed up he is with the<br> way the world is,<br>
							and that he's just <br>going to go on a "rampage"<br>
							so to speak. <br>This verse is obviously very inflammatory,<br>
							so he's showing us <br>how he really just doesn't<br>
							care anymore <br>about other's feelings.<br>

							--Applied Term--<br>
							S███al Response Cycle<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							My term choice will make much more sense<br>
							if you know what the song is about, so<br>
							allow me to explain... the song "Eat It Up"<br>
							by X is about, well, "eating {somebody} out".<br>
							This song is about an interaction that X had<br>
							with an unnamed girl, and the song focuses on<br>
							how she felt during this, well, interaction.<br>
							Oddly, the song follows (with near perfection)<br>
							the stages of the se**al response cycle...<br>
							although it is too vulgar for this class<br>
							(thus why it's not included here), there's<br>
							a section in this song that focuses exclusively<br>
							on female or**sms... Still a good song though.<br>

							--Applied Term--<br>
							Neophobia<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							This song, according to the experts,<br>
							is most likely directed towards his ex<br>
							girlfriend, and the trouble their relationship<br>
							went through. This song is literally about<br>
							changes, and how he doesn't know if the world<br>
							is going to be different tomorrow. It's a solemn<br>
							song, with a deep meaning, and it connects<br>
							perfectly into neophobia, commonly defined as<br>
							"the fear of new things or change".

							Relative Depravation<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							This song focuses on the inequalities <br>
							of the world, and how some of us don't <br>
							end up as well as the rest of us... <br>
							"Rock Bottom" focuses on how eminem grew<br>
							up, and the poverty and inequality he had<br>
							to deal with to get to where he is today...<br>
							He talks about how he's less than others, and<br>
							just wants to make some money and not live<br>
							in continuous debt, which fits the context of<br>
							"Relative Depravation" perfectly.<br>

							--Applied Term--<br>
							James-Lange theory<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							The James-Lange theory focuses on how stimuli preceed emotions<br>
							and actually cause the emotions to happen. This song, although<br>
							the lyrics are irrelevant, tends to cause goosebumps and an<br>
							increased heart rate in most people (according to my observations)<br>
							This means that the listener begins to feel afraid and is now in fear<br>
							which exactly supports the James-Lange theory.

							--Applied Term--<br>
							Catharsis<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							Catharsis is defined as a release of emotions and admission<br>
							of your true feelings. The first thing I thought of once I heard<br>
							this was the admission of love. That's why I chose "closer" by<br>
							the chainsmokers; it was the first and best song I thought of<br>
							that described love. It's about that type of unconditional love<br>
							that still carries on, and meeting that person again and feeling<br>
							the same way you did all those years ago.

							--Applied Term--<br>
							Learned Helplessness<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							Learned Helplessness refers to the point in which you<br>
							decide that pretty much everything you can do to affect<br>
							a situation cannot and will not affect the end result.<br>
							Basically, you admit that you are helpless to stop the result<br>
							and that the end is unstoppable. The first thing I thought of<br>
							was, you guessed it, love. We all know we can't stop loving that<br>
							one person sometimes, no matter how hard we try. This song illustrates<br>
							that perfectly.
