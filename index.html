							Avoiding Punishment ( Stage 1 )<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							The reason why I chose ridin'<br>
							by Chamillionare is because<br>
							this song is perfect for<br>
							trying to avoid punishment,<br>
							the main aspect of the first<br>
							stage of kohlberg's model.<br><br>
							He consistently talks about pretty<br>
							much being a car chase with<br>
							the police, and how they are<br>
							"not going to catch him".

							Individualism and Exchange ( Stage 2 )<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							Although this song is very explicit<br>
							in true meaning, it's a pretty<br>
							good song for explaining how one <br>
							individual only does things for<br>
							the other person's rewards.<br>
							It's pretty much an interaction between<br>
							two people, flirting with each other,<br>
							and describing what they would do<br>
							to the other individual.<br>
							If nothing at all, a very unique song.<br>

							--Applied Term--<br>
							Neophobia<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							This song, according to the experts,<br>
							is most likely directed towards his ex<br>
							girlfriend, and the trouble their relationship<br>
							went through. This song is literally about<br>
							changes, and how he doesn't know if the world<br>
							is going to be different tomorrow. It's a solemn<br>
							song, with a deep meaning, and it connects<br>
							perfectly into neophobia, commonly defined as<br>
							"the fear of new things or change".

							--Applied Term--<br>
							Relative Depravation<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							This song focuses on the inequalities <br>
							of the world, and how some of us don't <br>
							end up as well as the rest of us... <br>
							"Rock Bottom" focuses on how eminem grew<br>
							up, and the poverty and inequality he had<br>
							to deal with to get to where he is today...<br>
							He talks about how he's less than others, and<br>
							just wants to make some money and not live<br>
							in continuous debt, which fits the context of<br>
							"Relative Depravation" perfectly.<br>

							--Applied Term--<br>
							James-Lange theory<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							The James-Lange theory focuses on how stimuli preceed emotions<br>
							and actually cause the emotions to happen. This song, although<br>
							the lyrics are irrelevant, tends to cause goosebumps and an<br>
							increased heart rate in most people (according to my observations)<br>
							This means that the listener begins to feel afraid and is now in fear<br>
							which exactly supports the James-Lange theory.

							--Applied Term--<br>
							Catharsis<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							Catharsis is defined as a release of emotions and admission<br>
							of your true feelings. The first thing I thought of once I heard<br>
							this was the admission of love. That's why I chose "closer" by<br>
							the chainsmokers; it was the first and best song I thought of<br>
							that described love. It's about that type of unconditional love<br>
							that still carries on, and meeting that person again and feeling<br>
							the same way you did all those years ago.

						<em>
							-----------------------------------------<br>
							All this money can't buy me a time machine, no<br>
							I can't replace you with a million rings, no<br>
							I should've told you what you meant to me, no<br>
							'Cause now I pay the price<br>
							<br>
							'Cause In another life, I would be your girl<br>
							We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world<br>
							In another life, I would make you stay<br>

							--Applied Term--<br>
							Learned Helplessness<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							Learned Helplessness refers to the point in which you<br>
							decide that pretty much everything you can do to affect<br>
							a situation cannot and will not affect the end result.<br>
							Basically, you admit that you are helpless to stop the result<br>
							and that the end is unstoppable. The first thing I thought of<br>
							was, you guessed it, love. We all know we can't stop loving that<br>
							one person sometimes, no matter how hard we try. This song illustrates<br>
							that perfectly.
